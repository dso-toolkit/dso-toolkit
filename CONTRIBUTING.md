# Contributing to the DSO Toolkit
This repository houses several projects, and issues are labeled accordingly:
* `/packages/dso-toolkit`: A component library
* `/packages/styling`: A CSS implementation written in SCSS
* `/packages/core`: A Web Component implementation written in Stencil Components

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Language
There are two language domains: English and Dutch. Anything tech-related (styling, source code, standard open source files, etc) is in English. Anything else (Fractal notes, manuals, GitHub issues and comments) is in Dutch.

## How to contribute
Contributing to the DSO Toolkit is fairly straight-forward:
1. Fork
2. Open an issue
3. Contribute
4. Create a pull request

### 1. Fork
Fork the repository to your own - or your organisation's - namespace.

### 2. Open an issue
Every change is accomponied by an issue describing the change, scope, and incentive, and preferably a URL and test scenario. This way contributors, maintainers and product owners can reason about the suggested changes. Changes need to be approved by the owner of the repository.

Properly label the issue, see _labels_ section below.

### 3. Contribute
* Take note of the codestyle, we are using linters.
* Add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md.
* When changing the toolkit, demonstrate the change using the component library (new components or variants)
* Run `yarn test`. Commit new/changed reference DOM files using `yarn reference:dom`.

### 4. Create a pull request
Create a pull request to the target version branch, most likely `master`. A maintainer will review your changes, merge them, and close the issue. Label the issue with [status:review].

## Reviewing
When reviewing a pull request, make sure the items in __step 3. Contribute__ are checked. Pay special attention to the changelog and (if needed) reference DOM files.

## Labels
The repository uses different categories of labels.
* Package labels : what part of the codebase's resulting packages are affected
* Subject labels : issues concerning  attention subjects, such as 'accessibility', are labeled accordingly
* Type labels : indicates the type of issue, see below
* Status labels : for workflow, see below

Apart from these labels, issues are labeled [BREAKING] when causing major impact (such as a change in the API), and [question]

* [type:question] : Questions about how to use a component, or other types of support, or just general 'questions'
* [type:research] : Proof-of-concept issues & field research work that's worth sharing

### Status labels

* [status:in specification] : Issue needs refinement and approval to start working
* [status:ready] : Issue is fully specified and ready to start working on
* [status:in progress] : People are working on it
* [status:in review] : Change needs to be reviewed
* [status:testable] : Change is testable via the branch/version selector on https://dso-toolkit.nl/
